3D files for installing a USB-C port into a gamecube

This is a simple bracket that mounts a USB type-c trigger board in a gamecube. Currently the only model supports DOL-001 back plates, once I can get a DOL-101 to experiment with I will add those files to it as well.

For trimming the shell, all you need to do is trace the outline of the port on the shell, drill, and use some small files. I used a cheap set i got from harbor freight for ~$10usd

## Non-3D printed hardware

[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0953G14Q2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0953G14Q2) This is the USB-C board I used, it's 12v so you will need a brick that can output 12v/3a(this isn't a standard USB-C PD profile so you need to make sure your brick supports it, or you are buying one that does)

An alternative to the above is using a 15v trigger board(there are 15v varients of the one above in the same size, in the same listing) and a DC-DC buck converter to lower it to 12v. I haven't personally done this, but I've seen at least one person on reddit do it.

## Images
I recommend printing in this orientation(with supports):

Mounting angle(the front face goes against the inside back of the shell)
