3D files for installing a USB-C port into a gamecube

This is a simple bracket that mounts a USB type-c trigger board in a gamecube. Currently the only model supports DOL-001 back plates, once I can get a DOL-101 to experiment with I will add those files to it as well.

For trimming the shell, all you need to do is trace the outline of the port on the shell, drill, and use some small files. I used a cheap set i got from harbor freight for ~$10usd

## Images
I recommend printing in this orientation:

Mounting angle(the front face goes against the inside back of the shell)
